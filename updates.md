## March 21

Looked into PGA tour CSV's on github. Might scrape data myself

## March 23 Beginning of Class

Found data set and selected only the required variables. Currently thinking about what I want to present in Shiny. 

## March 23 End of Class

Created an initial static visualization of strokes gained from winners as an idea for shiny presentation. 

##March 28th Beginning of Class

Continued to think about what I wanted my shiny app to display. Created another static plot that would go with the strokes gained from each torunament. Also looked into a radar chart. Even though they are typically not good.

## March 28th End of Class
Continued to play around with Radar Chart and transitioning static plots to shiny plots


## March 30th Beginning of Class
Got a working shiny program for first graph, want to add second tab and other graphs to shiny. 

## March 3oth End of Class
Worked on adding a second graph below first one using fluidRow but struggled. Got better understanding of statistics im using and what they actually reprsent. 

## April 4th Beginning of Class
Didn't make much progress on the shiny end of things. Graph not always popping up in correct position. Radar chart not comparing stats either. 

## April 4th End of Class
Got both plots to show up and managed to order the bottom plot by strokes. Would like to change top plot to multiple lines plot and maybe have a way of showing par for the course as well.

##April 6th Beginning of Class
Got a static plot of parallel coordinate plot but didn't love the way it looked. Tried to create a new data set that would plot ALL rounds by any player who has won the tournament but struggled. Need to create new variable called has won. Then a user could highlight a winners color to see better. 

## April 6th end of class
Worked on creating a variable has won to try and plot all rounds played by winners. Got Reprex to work but still problems apllying it. 

##April 11th Before class 
Got variable haswon to wotk and got plot to work. However didn't like the plot still so researched other presentation formats. Got boxplot and parallel lines on same plot but very crowded. Looking for other options...

##April 13th Before class 
Wanted to create another tab that had a pie chart of the selected golfers made cuts percentage but found troubles displaying the count/percent. Moved onto a simple boxplot 

##April 18th Before Class
Got boxplot to work finally. Worked on adding it to shiny app under a new tab.

##April 18th After Class
Got made cuts plot to work in shiny by itself now just need to add it to another tab. Maybe add a comparison to check two players against eachother. 

## APril 25th Before Class
Still struggling to get second tab to work. Played with adding comparison plot for made cuts for tournmanet, all time avg, and comparing to another player. 

## April 25th After class Fixed second page pf shiny and know how to combine now. Looked for larger dataset to scrape but no luck

## April 27th Before Class
Pretty up the first page of shint, treid adding a comparative boxplot but still not working. multiple pages still not working
