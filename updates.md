## March 21

Looked into PGA tour CSV's on github. Might scrape data myself

## March 23 Beginning of Class

Found data set and selected only the required variables. Currently thinking about what I want to present in Shiny. 

## March 23 End of Class

Created an initial static visualization of strokes gained from winners as an idea for shiny presentation. 

##March 28th Beginning of Class

Continued to think about what I wanted my shiny app to display. Created another static plot that would go with the strokes gained from each torunament. Also looked into a radar chart. Even though they are typically not good.

## March 28th End of Class
Continued to play around with Radar Chart and transitioning static plots to shiny plots


## March 30th Beginning of Class
Got a working shiny program for first graph, want to add second tab and other graphs to shiny. 

## March 3oth End of Class
Worked on adding a second graph below first one using fluidRow but struggled. Got better understanding of statistics im using and what they actually reprsent. 

## April 4th Beginning of Class
Didn't make much progress on the shiny end of things. Graph not always popping up in correct position. Radar chart not comparing stats either. 

## April 4th End of Class
Got both plots to show up and managed to order the bottom plot by strokes. Would like to change top plot to multiple lines plot and maybe have a way of showing par for the course as well.
